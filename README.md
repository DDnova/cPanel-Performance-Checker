# Website Load Check Script for cPanel Servers

This Bash script performs a check on a cPanel server to monitor various aspects of its performance, including CPU load, memory usage, disk usage, and the status of critical services such as Apache (httpd) and MySQL/MariaDB. Additionally, it provides suggestions for optimizing the server based on the findings.

## Features

### 1. CPU Load Check

- **Description**: Checks the current CPU load and compares it with the number of available CPU cores.
- **Action**: Provides suggestions if the CPU load is higher than the number of cores.

### 2. Memory Usage Check

- **Description**: Displays the current memory usage in GB and percentage.
- **Action**: Provides suggestions if memory usage is higher than 95%.

### 3. Disk Usage Check

- **Description**: Displays the current disk usage of the root partition.
- **Action**: Provides suggestions if disk usage is higher than 98%.

### 4. Apache (httpd) Status Check

- **Description**: Checks if the Apache (httpd) service is running.
- **Action**: Provides suggestions if the service is not running.

### 5. MySQL/MariaDB Status Check

- **Description**: Checks if either MySQL or MariaDB service is running.
- **Action**: Provides suggestions if neither service is running.

### 6. MySQL Sleep Queries Check

- **Description**: Counts the number of MySQL sleep queries.
- **Action**: Provides suggestions if there are more than 1 sleep queries.

### 7. Apache MaxRequestWorkers Check

- **Description**: Displays the current `MaxRequestWorkers` setting in the Apache configuration.

### 8. PHP-FPM max_children Check

- **Description**: Checks for warnings in PHP-FPM logs indicating that the `max_children` setting has been reached.
- **Action**: Provides the most recent warning log entry as a suggestion if the setting is reached.

### 9. Calculate Optimal MaxRequestWorkers

- **Description**: Calculates the optimal `MaxRequestWorkers` setting based on the available memory and average memory usage of Apache processes.
- **Action**: Provides suggestions to adjust `MaxRequestWorkers` and `ServerLimit` if necessary.

## Detailed Breakdown

### CPU Load Check

- **Function**: Monitor CPU load and compare with CPU core count.
- **Suggestion Criteria**: CPU load > Number of CPU cores.

### Memory Usage Check

- **Function**: Display memory usage.
- **Critical Threshold**: 95% usage.
- **Output**: 
  - Current memory usage (GB).
  - Percentage usage.

### Disk Usage Check

- **Function**: Display root partition disk usage.
- **Critical Threshold**: 98% usage.
- **Output**: 
  - Current disk usage.
  - Percentage usage.

### Apache (httpd) Status Check

- **Function**: Check if Apache service is running.
- **Action**: 
  - Suggestion if Apache is not running.

### MySQL/MariaDB Status Check

- **Function**: Check if MySQL or MariaDB service is running.
- **Action**: 
  - Suggestion if neither service is running.

### MySQL Sleep Queries Check

- **Function**: Count MySQL sleep queries.
- **Critical Threshold**: More than 10 sleep queries.
- **Action**: 
  - Suggestion if sleep queries exceed the threshold.

### Apache MaxRequestWorkers Check

- **Function**: Display the current `MaxRequestWorkers` setting.
- **Output**: 
  - Current `MaxRequestWorkers` value.

### PHP-FPM max_children Check

- **Function**: Check PHP-FPM logs for `max_children` warnings.
- **Action**: 
  - Provide the most recent warning if `max_children` setting is reached.

### Calculate Optimal MaxRequestWorkers

- **Function**: Calculate optimal `MaxRequestWorkers` based on available memory and Apache process usage.
- **Action**: 
  - Suggest adjustments to `MaxRequestWorkers` and `ServerLimit` settings.
